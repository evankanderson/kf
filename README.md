# Kf

Kf is now a fully supported Google Cloud tool, and has its own dedicated
documentation. Please use [this
site](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/kf/docs) for getting the latest updates
on Kf.

## Dashboards

If you are using Google Cloud Logging, Kf has some pre-built templates. They can
be found in the [dashboards](dashboards) directory. This includes a script
that can be ran that will setup everything for you.
